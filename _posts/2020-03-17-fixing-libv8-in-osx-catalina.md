### Background

### In this blog, we will try to answer the following questions:
1. [Why do we need `libv8`?](#why-do-we-need-libv8)
    - a. [How is it related to `therubyracer`?](#how-is-it-related-to-therubyracer)
2. [Why does installation through `bundle install` fails?](#why-does-installation-through-bundle-install-fails)
3. [How do we fix it?](#how-do-we-fix-it)

### Why do we need `libv8`?
Before we talk about `libv8`, let's first take a look what is [V8](https://v8.dev/)  
> V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.

So, basically, V8 is the Javascript engine in Chrome.

#### How is it related to `therubyracer`?

### Why does installation through `bundle install` fails?

### How do we fix it?



<!-- [libv8][libv8-github]{:target="_blank"} is a Javascript engine.


```
brew install v8-315

gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.19' -- --with-system-v8
gem install therubyracer -- --with-v8-dir=/usr/local/opt/v8@315

bundle install
```

Questions:
- [ ] What is the `--` doing in `gem install`?
- [ ] What does `v8` and `therubyracer` do?
- [ ] Why does it fails in normal case when installing in OSX?
