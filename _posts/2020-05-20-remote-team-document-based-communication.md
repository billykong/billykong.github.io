### Background

### Overview

1. directory structure
    - What kind of document is needed for the day-to-day operations?
2. markdown
    - What needs to be in a document?
3. merge request and async
    - How do we communicate through documents?


### What is gained?

- How efficient is this document-based communication approach?
- How does it compare to traditional meeting and office face-to-face communication?

### What needs to be changed?

- What behaviour adaption is required to switch from verbal communication to document-based communication?
