### Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes to our lives, one of them being many people needs to work from home now. As from my experience as a software engineer, the biggest changes our daily work is how do we communicate efficiently.  
  
I am happy to see that many other companies have found their way, mostly software companies. And I am glad that we too found a way to work even more efficiently than before.

We call our way **document-based communication**. It is inspired by the handbook-based communication as shared by [GitLab](https://gitlab.com). By the way, it is really a valuable reference to how to run different departments of a software company there. I am so happy that they are able to condense their valuable experience into a single document and open source it.

I would like to share our approach here with some details. For anyone who may be looking for a way to build and run a remote team, I hope this is useful.


### Overview


1. directory structure
    - What kind of document is needed for the day-to-day operations?
    - team responsbility
    - features
    - technical notes
    
2. markdown
    - What needs to be in a document?
    - easy to write 
    - easy for source code control
    
3. merge request and async
    - How do we communicate through documents?
    - precise communication
    - async communication
    - higher throughput, but more latency


### What is gained?

- How efficient is this document-based communication approach?
    + over 100 precise communications thread
- How does it compare to traditional meeting and office face-to-face communication?
    + more precise
    + more about the task, not the person
    + async, so good to plan ahead and concurrent tasks
    + easier to iterate ideas

### What needs to be changed?

- What behaviour adaption is required to switch from verbal communication to document-based communication?
    + write it out instead of speaking
    + emoji helps
    + read

### Conclusion
It is an efficient, impartial, system.
It requires some technical capability, but really not much.
You may encounter resistence, but even if you can only successfully promote it within your team. The benefit is still worths it.
